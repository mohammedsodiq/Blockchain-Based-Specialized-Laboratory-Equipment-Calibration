# Blockchain-Based Specialized Laboratory Equipment Calibration

A decentralized platform for registering, scheduling, and verifying the calibration of precision scientific instruments with immutable record-keeping for regulatory compliance.

## Overview

This blockchain-based system provides a comprehensive solution for laboratory equipment calibration management, ensuring accuracy, traceability, and regulatory compliance. By leveraging distributed ledger technology, the platform creates tamper-proof records of calibration activities while streamlining processes for laboratories, technicians, and regulatory authorities.

## Core Components

### Device Registration Contract

The device registration contract establishes a verifiable record of all laboratory instruments requiring calibration.

- **Instrument Onboarding**: Comprehensive registration of precision scientific equipment
- **Specification Management**: Storage of instrument parameters, acceptable tolerances, and calibration requirements
- **Digital Twin Creation**: Blockchain representation of physical instruments with complete history
- **Ownership Tracking**: Clear records of instrument custody and location
- **Instrument Classification**: Categorization by type, precision level, and regulatory requirements

### Technician Certification Contract

This contract verifies and manages the qualifications of personnel authorized to perform calibration activities.

- **Certification Verification**: Validation of technician credentials and qualifications
- **Specialization Registry**: Recording of equipment types each technician is certified to calibrate
- **Continuing Education Tracking**: Monitoring of required training and recertification
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of technician activities and performance metrics
- **Authority Management**: Control over who can certify technicians and under what standards

### Calibration Scheduling Contract

Manages the full lifecycle of calibration events from planning to execution.

- **Automated Scheduling**: Smart contract-driven notification of upcoming calibration needs
- **Calendar Management**: Coordination of instrument availability and technician schedules
- **Priority Assignment**: Risk-based calibration scheduling for critical instruments
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time visibility into calibration status across the organization
- **Deviation Handling**: Processes for managing calibration failures or out-of-specification results

### Compliance Documentation Contract

Generates and maintains immutable records of calibration activities to satisfy regulatory requirements.

- **Certificate Generation**: Creation of blockchain-verified calibration certificates
- **Regulatory Mapping**: Association of calibration records with specific regulatory requirements
- **Audit Support**: Simplified generation of compliance reports for inspections
- **Record Retention**: Immutable storage of calibration history for required timeframes
- **Electronic Signatures**: Cryptographic verification of responsible parties

## Technical Architecture

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, or other enterprise-grade blockchain
- **Smart Contracts**: Self-executing contracts with calibration business logic
- **Storage**: On-chain for critical metadata, IPFS for detailed calibration reports
- **IoT Integration**: Connection with calibration instruments for automated data recording
- **Interoperability**: API integration with LIMS and quality management systems

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Truffle or Hardhat development framework
- Web3 provider connection
- Access to test blockchain network

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/lab-calibration-blockchain.git
   cd lab-calibration-blockchain
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your specific configuration values.

4. Compile contracts:
   ```
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

5. Deploy to network:
   ```
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network [network-name]
   ```

## Usage Examples

### For Laboratory Managers

```javascript
// Register new laboratory equipment
await deviceContract.registerInstrument(
  instrumentType,
  serialNumber,
  manufacturerInfo,
  calibrationRequirements,
  regulatoryClassification
);

// Schedule calibration
await schedulingContract.createCalibrationEvent(
  instrumentId,
  desiredTimeframe,
  priorityLevel,
  specificRequirements
);
```

### For Calibration Technicians

```javascript
// Record calibration results
await complianceContract.recordCalibration(
  instrumentId,
  calibrationDate,
  measurementResults,
  referenceStandards,
  deviationNotes
);

// Generate calibration certificate
const certificateId = await complianceContract.generateCertificate(
  calibrationId,
  technician,
  approver,
  expirationDate
);
```

### For Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs

```javascript
// Generate compliance report
const complianceReport = await complianceContract.generateRegulatoryReport(
  regulationType,
  dateRange,
  departmentId
);

// Verify calibration status
const calibrationStatus = await deviceContract.checkInstrumentCompliance(
  instrumentId
);
```

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Data Integrity**: Immutable record of all calibration activities
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Simplified documentation for FDA, ISO, GLP, and other requirements
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated scheduling and notification systems
- **Risk Reduction**: Improved visibility into calibration status and history
- **Audit Preparation**: Readily available, tamper-proof calibration records
- **Quality Assurance**: Better tracking of instrument performance over time

## Roadmap
